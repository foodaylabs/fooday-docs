# What is Fooday?

![Banner](./what-is-fooday-medium.jpeg)

Welcome to Fooday, the game-changing restaurant review platform! We are excited to announce that Fooday is much more than just a place to leave reviews — it’s a community-driven platform where foodies can not only share their experiences but also create and discover new dining spots.

With Fooday, users can not only post their reviews and ratings on various criteria, such as food quality, service, atmosphere, and value for money but also create a listing for their favorite restaurant or a new dining spot they’ve discovered. These listings are then added to the Fooday map, making it easy for other users to find and visit the restaurant.

Fooday leverages the latest in web3 technology, including tokenomics and peer-to-peer validation, to provide a new level of accuracy and reliability in the world of restaurant reviews. And with GPS technology, Fooday ensures that users are actually at the restaurant they are reviewing, providing an extra layer of trust to the review process.

# Today’s Problems

![Problems Banner](./problem.webp)

Current restaurant review platforms have several major issues that can negatively impact the user experience. Some of the biggest problems include:

- **Inaccurate Reviews:**
  Many restaurant review platforms are plagued by fake reviews, either written by the restaurants themselves or paid individuals. This can make it difficult for users to get a true sense of what a restaurant is really like.

- **Bias:**
  Some restaurant review platforms are biased towards certain restaurants, either due to advertising relationships or other factors. This can make it difficult for users to get an impartial assessment of a restaurant.

- **Lack of Trust:**
  With so many fake and biased reviews, it can be difficult for users to trust the information they find on restaurant review platforms. This can lead to frustration and a sense of disillusionment with the review process.

- **Outdated Information:**
  Restaurants and their offerings can change quickly, but traditional review platforms may not reflect these changes in a timely manner. This can lead to outdated information and a poor user experience.

- **Lack of Incentive:**
  Many restaurant review platforms do not provide a compelling reason for users to leave detailed, accurate reviews. This can result in a lack of information and a limited pool of reviews to draw from.
