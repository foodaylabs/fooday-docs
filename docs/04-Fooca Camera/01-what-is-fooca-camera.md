title: What is Fooca Camera
---

The Fooca Camera is a unique NFT exclusive to Fooday, designed to enhance the Foodie experience within the community while simultaneously driving the platform's growth.

But what is the purpose of the Fooca Camera? The Fooca Camera serves as the entry ticket to Fooday's culinary community, essential for foodies looking to earn rewards while indulging in the world of food. 

>In simple terms, without a Fooca Camera, foodies won't be able to kickstart their journey to earning rewards.

The Fooca Camera NFT is not just your typical NFT; it comes with levels, battery, and four distinct attributes: compute, quality, battery, and foospirit. 

Each attribute affects the performance efficiency of the Fooca Camera, and the number of Fooca Cameras a foodie possesses determines their account's energy value on the platform.

### A Guarantee for the Culinary Community
Furthermore, the Fooca Camera also acts as collateral for the Fooday platform. In cases where a foodie repeatedly posts malicious reviews or violates community guidelines, Fooday may confiscate their cameras as a penalty, ensuring the peace and fairness of the community.
