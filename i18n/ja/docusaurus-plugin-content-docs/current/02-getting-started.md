## 3. Get FUSD to Purchase Fooca Cameras

To start EAT & EARN, you'll first need to obtain FUSD and purchase Fooca Cameras.

Currently, there are two ways to acquire FUSD within Fooday:
1. Purchase FUSD directly from within the Fooday App.
2. Transfer USDC to your Fooday wallet from the Polygon network, where it will automatically convert to FUSD (Rabby wallet, exchanges).

### Method 1: Purchase FUSD Within the Fooday App

If you're not familiar with blockchain and on-chain transactions, purchasing FUSD directly within the Fooday app is the quickest method. It's a straightforward process – simply click on the right-most option in the menu, select "Purchase FUSD," and choose the amount you wish to buy. FUSD will be automatically deposited into your Fooday wallet, similar to making in-app purchases in other mobile games.

### Method 2: Transfer USDC to Your Fooday Wallet

The second method involves transferring USDC or USDC.e from your blockchain wallet to your Fooday wallet. Below, we'll provide instructions using the Rabby wallet as an example, but you can use other wallets or exchanges as well.

> Currently, Fooday only supports the Polygon network, which will be automatically selected

* USDC Contract Address: `0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359`  
* USDC.e Contract Address: `0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174`

#### Step-by-step Guide:

1. After opening Fooday, click on the right-most option in the menu, then select "FUSD" within the wallet section. On the next page, click "Deposit."
2. Next, press the "Deposit" button at the bottom, which will take you to your FUSD transfer address. 
3. Copy the address and return to your Rabby wallet. Click "SEND," select the Polygon network, and paste the wallet address you copied from Fooday. Enter the amount of USDC (or FOOD) you want to deposit and send it. (FUSD: USDC = 1:1)

5. Once confirmed, you can use FUSD to purchase Fooca Cameras in the marketplace and begin EAT & EARN! 

:::note
Be sure to select the Polygon network – Fooday currently exclusively supports Polygon. The above instructions are for depositing funds using the Rabby wallet, but you can use other wallets as well.
